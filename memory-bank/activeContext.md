# Active Context

**Current Session Focus**: Voice Pipeline Complete - Ready for Command Processing Implementation

## ✅ Recently Completed
- Successfully integrated Gemini 2.0 Flash Live API replacing separate STT/LLM/TTS services
- Established working WebSocket bridge between Electron UI and Pipecat backend
- Achieved end-to-end voice processing: Audio → Gemini Live → Audio output
- Fixed UI layout and communication issues for stable voice interaction
- Completed comprehensive requirements analysis identifying implementation gaps

## 🎯 Current Working Status
**Voice Pipeline**: ✅ 100% Complete - Gemini Live API fully functional
**UI Communication**: ✅ 90% Complete - WebSocket bridge working with minor activation issue
**Electron App**: ✅ Complete - Hotkey activation (Ctrl+Shift+X) and basic UI
**Audio Processing**: ✅ Complete - Microphone selection and capture working
**End-to-End Flow**: ✅ Working - User can speak and get AI responses

**Current User Experience**:
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+X → UI appears
2. Speak → Gemini Live processes voice and responds
3. Get both spoken response and text display
4. UI auto-hides when focus lost

## 🚧 Current Known Issues
- **Command Processing:** Basic implementation complete. `intent_parser.py` uses keyword matching for 'greet' and 'create task'. `command_processor.py` handles these intents with stubbed text responses. Integrated into `pipecat_pipeline.py` and `websocket_server.py` to process text commands sent from the Electron UI via the `SEND_TEXT` WebSocket message.
- **Data Persistence (Firebase Firestore):** Not implemented. No data is saved. Command processor currently only returns text; no database interaction.
3. **No External Actions** - Cannot create tasks, notes, or reminders

## 🚨 CRITICAL GAPS FOR PRODUCTIVITY FUNCTIONALITY

### Immediate Blockers (Next 4 Weeks)
1. **Command Classification** - Intent recognition for "take note", "create task", "set reminder"
2. **Data Storage** - Firebase Firestore integration for persistent goals/tasks/notes
3. **Action Handlers** - Logic to actually create and store productivity items
4. **External Integration** - At least one Zapier connection (Trello recommended)

### Architecture Achieved vs Needed
**Current**: Voice Echo System
```
User Voice → Gemini Live → AI Response → User
```

**Target MVP**: Productivity Command System
```
User Voice → Intent Classification → Action Handler → External Service → Confirmation
```

## 🎯 Next 4-Week Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Command Processing Foundation
- **Fix Pipeline Activation**: Voice only on hotkey press
- **Basic Intent Classification**: Recognize "note", "task", "reminder", "timer" commands
- **Parameter Extraction**: Extract basic info (description, priority, due date)
- **Command Validation**: Confirm understanding before action

### Week 2: Data Persistence Setup
- **Firebase Firestore Project**: Set up cloud database
- **Data Models**: Design schema for goals, tasks, notes, reminders
- **Basic CRUD**: Create, read, update operations for productivity items
- **Local Storage**: Fallback for offline scenarios

### Week 3: Action Handlers & External Integration
- **Action Dispatch**: Route commands to appropriate handlers
- **Local Actions**: Create/store items locally first
- **Zapier Setup**: Configure webhook system
- **Trello Integration**: Basic task creation in Trello boards

### Week 4: Daily Briefing & Polish
- **Morning Briefing**: Yesterday's progress + today's agenda
- **Progress Tracking**: Basic completion status
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures and user feedback
- **User Testing**: Validate MVP functionality

## 📋 Technical Architecture Status

**Completed Components**:
- ✅ Electron desktop app with system hotkey
- ✅ Pipecat voice processing framework
- ✅ Gemini Live API integration (STT+LLM+TTS)
- ✅ WebSocket communication bridge
- ✅ Audio input/output handling
- ✅ Basic UI with real-time feedback

**Missing Components**:
- ❌ Command/intent classification system
- ❌ Persistent data storage (Firebase Firestore)
- ❌ External API integrations (Zapier)
- ❌ Goal management logic
- ❌ Daily briefing system
- ❌ Timer/reminder functionality
- ❌ Contextual awareness (browser/window detection)

## 🎯 MVP Success Criteria (4 Weeks)
- User says "take a note about project meeting" → Note saved to Notion
- User says "create task to review proposal" → Task appears in Trello
- User says "set reminder for 3pm call" → Reminder set in Google Calendar
- Morning activation shows yesterday's completed tasks and today's priorities
- Sub-2-second response time maintained

## Key Decisions Made
- **Voice Processing**: Gemini 2.0 Flash Live API (unified STT+LLM+TTS)
- **Framework**: Pipecat-AI for voice orchestration
- **UI**: Electron with WebSocket communication
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore for cloud storage
- **Integrations**: Zapier for external services

## Key Decisions Pending
- **Command Classification**: Rule-based vs ML approach for intent recognition
- **Database Schema**: Specific data models for productivity items
- **Integration Priority**: Which Zapier service to implement first (Trello recommended)
- **Offline Strategy**: Local queue vs online-only for MVP

## Today's Focus
**COMMAND PROCESSING ENHANCEMENT**: Focus on implementing robust command classification and Firestore data persistence to bridge the gap between basic keyword matching and documented advanced LLM-powered intent classification.

### Immediate Next Steps:
1.  **Enhanced Intent Classification**: Improve command processing beyond basic keyword matching using Gemini Live API capabilities.
2.  **Firestore Data Persistence**: Implement actual data persistence for tasks, goals, and other entities.
3.  **Basic Interaction**: Test with a simple prompt to ensure the LLM receives input and generates a response that is then spoken.
4.  **Electron-Pipecat Communication Strategy**: Continue research and decide on method (e.g., WebSockets, local HTTP server).

## Key Decisions Made (This Session)
- Adopted **Pipecat-AI** as the primary framework for building the voice agent's core logic.
- Existing Google Cloud STT/TTS are integrated via Pipecat's dedicated services.
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Live API** implemented as unified voice processing solution.
- Gemini API key configured in `.env`.
- Basic Pipecat STT/TTS pipeline is functional.

## Key Decisions Pending
- Communication mechanism between Electron frontend and Pipecat backend.
- Detailed design of how the 7-node architecture maps to Pipecat services and flows.
- How to integrate Zapier/direct API calls for actions (Trello, Notion) from within Pipecat flows.

## Current Implementation Status
- `pipecat-ai` and `pipecat-ai[google]` installed.
- Basic Pipecat pipeline (STT -> TTS) is functional.
- **Currently working on enhancing command processing and data persistence.**
- Gemini Live API successfully integrated and functional.

## Known Issues
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` message still shows in console if not set before `googleCloudClients.js` is first imported, even if `dotenv` loads it later. (Minor, may become irrelevant with Pipecat).

## Success Criteria for This Focus
- [x] `pipecat-ai` and `pipecat-ai[google]` successfully installed.
- [x] Basic Pipecat pipeline runs, taking audio input, transcribing with Google STT, and speaking back with Google TTS.
- [✅] Gemini 2.0 Flash Live API integrated and functional within Pipecat pipeline.
- [ ] Enhanced command processing with improved intent classification.
- [✅] Firestore data persistence for tasks and goals. *(Fixed credentials path - now working)*
- [ ] Initial plan for Electron-Pipecat communication drafted.

## Next Session Preview
Enhance command processing capabilities and implement Firestore data persistence. Focus on bridging the gap between current keyword-based processing and documented advanced intent classification.

## Planning Phase Completed
- [x] Critical platform and feature priorities established
- [x] Voice interaction validation requirements added to PRD
- [x] Desktop framework selected (Electron)
- [x] Architecture diagram created for voice workflow
- [x] Complete project structure defined
- [x] Implementation plan created

## Next Session Preview
Based on framework selection: Configure development environment, set up Google Cloud APIs, and create voice input capture MVP.
