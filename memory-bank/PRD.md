# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

**AI Productivity Agent** is a desktop-first personal assistant that transforms goal management and daily productivity. Using advanced LLM capabilities, it breaks down high-level goals into actionable tasks, prioritizes work based on deadlines and importance, and provides intelligent daily briefings.

The agent features seamless voice and text interaction through hotkey activation, integrating Gemini 2.0 Flash Live API for unified speech-to-text, LLM processing, and text-to-speech capabilities. Built on a seven-node architecture (LLM, Tool, Control, Memory, Input, Guardrail, Fallback), it is designed to connect with Trello, Notion, and Google Calendar via Zapier for comprehensive workflow management (external integrations planned for future releases).

Targeting busy professionals and students, it reduces cognitive load by preventing important tasks from falling through cracks while maintaining an intuitive, minimalist interface that fits naturally into existing workflows.

### Requirement: Voice Input Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure reliable understanding of user voice commands by adding a validation and correction layer between speech-to-text and command execution.

**Requirements**:
1. **Error Detection**: System shall analyze speech-to-text output for:
   - Grammatical errors
   - Syntactical problems
   - Punctuation mistakes
   - Logical inconsistencies

2. **Correction Mechanism**: System shall apply corrections to recognized errors when confidence is high.

3. **Clarification Protocol**: When voice input is ambiguous or confidence in correction is low:
   - Agent shall prompt user with specific clarification questions
   - Agent shall present its understanding and ask for confirmation
   - User shall have ability to confirm, reject, or modify the interpreted command

4. **Input Processing Flow**:
   ```
   Voice Input → Speech-to-Text → Validation Layer → Correction/Clarification → Command Processing
   ```

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Background noise handling
   - Handling of specialized terminology
   - Adapting to user speech patterns over time

6. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Clarification frequency rate
   - Command rejection rate
   - Successful validation rate
   - Average processing time (target: <1 second)
