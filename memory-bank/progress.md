# Progress Log

## 2024-12-19 ‚Äì ‚úÖ Plan Mode Initialization Complete
- Created complete memory bank structure with all required files
- Drafted comprehensive PRD with 5W+H clarification framework  
- Established 15+ specific open questions across all requirement categories
- Set up task backlog with clear progression from clarification ‚Üí setup ‚Üí implementation
- Configured active context for systematic requirements gathering
- Ready to begin structured clarification phase per cursor rules methodology

## 2024-12-19 ‚Äì ‚úÖ Core Requirements Established
- Established Windows as primary target platform
- Prioritized voice interaction workflow as most critical initial feature
- Defined dedicated voice input validation layer with grammar/syntax checking
- Selected full cloud approach for all components (APIs, LLM, storage)
- Narrowed technology choices to accelerate MVP development
- Created new "Voice Input Validation" requirement section in PRD
- Reorganized task backlog with high-priority Voice Workflow MVP tasks
- Defined 9 core components for voice workflow implementation 

## 2024-12-19 ‚Äì ‚ö†Ô∏è Electron Implementation Started with Issues
- Created Electron application structure with main process, preload script, and renderer
- Implemented configuration system using electron-store
- Added utility modules for hotkey management and logging
- Set up simulated voice processing flow for MVP demonstration
- Encountered issue with electron-store integration: "TypeError: Store is not a constructor"
- Attempted multiple fixes including correct import syntax, but issue persists
- Application currently unable to start due to configuration module error 

## 2024-05-24 ‚Äì ‚úÖ Application Startup and Hotkey Resolved
- Successfully diagnosed and resolved the `electron-store` compatibility issues by downgrading to v8.2.0 and ensuring correct CommonJS import syntax.
- Fixed the `TypeError: Store is not a constructor` error.
- Modified application startup behavior to show the main window immediately, instead of waiting for a hotkey.
- Changed the default activation hotkey to `Ctrl+Shift+X` to avoid conflicts with Windows system hotkeys.
- Implemented a temporary configuration reset on startup to clear stale settings and ensure new defaults are applied.
- Application now launches successfully, the main window is visible, and the `Ctrl+Shift+X` hotkey correctly toggles window visibility. Basic simulated interaction flow is observable. 

## 2024-05-24 ‚Äì üöß Microphone Selection UI Implemented
- Added microphone selection dropdown and refresh button to the renderer UI.
- Implemented IPC communication for getting/setting selected microphone and storing preference.
- Used `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` to populate dropdown.
- Resolved UI interactivity issues for the dropdown using `-webkit-app-region: no-drag;` and explicit CSS styling.
- Adjusted default window height in config for better layout.
- **Current Issue**: Audio recording does not start reliably; hotkey trigger needs debugging, and `node-mic` device ID compatibility needs to be addressed. 

## 2024-05-25 ‚Äì ‚úÖ Basic STT and TTS with Google Cloud Implemented
- Resolved `node-mic` instantiation issues, enabling audio capture.
- Set up `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` using `dotenv` for persistent configuration.
- Successfully integrated Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API; voice input is transcribed.
- Successfully integrated Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API; test audio can be synthesized and played.
- Debugged renderer UI button click responsiveness for TTS testing. 

## 2024-05-25 ‚Äì ‚úÖ Basic Voice Interaction Loop Established
- Implemented a basic command handler in `main.js` (echo functionality).
- Connected STT output to the command handler.
- Fed command handler's text response to Google TTS for audio playback.
- Displayed the command handler's text response in the UI.
- Successfully tested the end-to-end flow: user speaks, system transcribes, echoes text and speech. 

## 2024-05-25 ‚Äì ‚úÖ Architectural Shift: Adopted Pipecat Framework
- Researched Pipecat-AI framework for voice agent development.
- Confirmed Pipecat can integrate with existing Google Cloud STT/TTS services.
- Identified Pipecat Flows as suitable for managing conversational logic and task orchestration.
- Decision made to use Pipecat for building the core voice agent, superseding previous plans for custom command handler logic outside a dedicated voice framework.
- Updated `techContext.md` and `TASK.md` to reflect this new direction and outline Pipecat integration steps.

## 2024-05-25 ‚Äì [x] **UI**: Display LLM/command response text in UI. 

## 2024-05-25 ‚Äì ‚úÖ Resolved Pipecat Google STT Permission Issue
- Investigated and resolved `403 Permission 'speech.recognizers.recognize' denied` error with Pipecat's `GoogleSTTService`.
- Confirmed `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` was set correctly.
- Verified direct `google.cloud.speech.SpeechClient` worked, isolating the issue to Pipecat's V2 API usage.
- Identified that Pipecat's `GoogleSTTService` uses the V2 API and a recognizer path like `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/global/recognizers/_`.
- Resolved the issue by adding the `Cloud Speech Administrator` role (or equivalent granting `speech.recognizers.recognize` permission) to the service account in Google Cloud IAM.
- Pipecat pipeline now successfully performs STT and TTS with Google Cloud services. 

## 2024-06-15 ‚Äì ‚úÖ Swapped Gemini API for DeepSeek integration Hmm.

## 2024-06-15 ‚Äì ‚úÖ Set up DeepSeek LLM integration
- Created `deepseek_integration.py` with Pipecat-compatible service
- Updated `techContext.md` with API details

## 2025-01-26 ‚Äì ‚úÖ Fixed WebSocket Integration and UI Issues
- Removed unnecessary manual control buttons (start/stop listening, text input) - reverted to clean hotkey-based design
- Fixed Python import error in pipecat_pipeline.py (websocket_server module path)
- Corrected WebSocketBridgeProcessor by adding required super().process_frame() call
- Improved UI layout with dynamic sizing and scroll support to prevent content clipping
- Integrated Pipecat backend startup directly into Electron main process (removed separate startup script)
- Updated hotkey behavior to route through Pipecat instead of legacy Google Cloud STT
- **Known Issue**: Pipeline listens continuously even when UI is hidden - should only activate on hotkey press

- Integrated new FrameProcessors into `pipecat_pipeline.py`.
- Updated `websocket_server.py` to route UI text input through the pipeline.
- Deleted obsolete `intent_parser.py` and `command_processor.py` files.
- This aligns command/intent handling with Pipecat's native architecture.
- Implemented AudioGateProcessor to control audio flow in Pipecat pipeline
- Added start/stop listening WebSocket commands between Electron and Pipecat
- Modified main.js to send stop-listening events when window is hidden or hotkey pressed
