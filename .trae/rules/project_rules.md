# Trae IDE Rules - Transferred from .cursorrules

## Memory Bank & Workflow

### Maintain Memory Bank
Treat memory-bank/ as the canonical knowledge store.
Keep these files fresh and commit them with related code:

*   PRD.md ‚Äì Product requirements with project overview and functional requirements FR1-FR12
*   architecture.md ‚Äì Technical design, technology stack, and ADR decisions
*   TASK.md ‚Äì Backlog ‚ñ∏ In-Progress ‚ñ∏ Done checklist with emoji status legend

*   progress.md ‚Äì "YYYY-MM-DD ‚Äì ‚úÖ summary" per completed task
*   MANUAL_ACTIONS.md ‚Äì Steps requiring manual intervention

### Memory Bank Hygiene
Prevent redundancy and staleness:

*   Delete files when content is fully covered elsewhere
*   Archive outdated planning docs that don't reflect current implementation
*   Validate that all referenced files exist before committing
*   If creating new memory bank files, justify why existing files can't be extended

### Unit-test policy (all languages)
Every new function/class gets success, edge and failure tests under /tests mirroring source path.



### On-demand tech-rule sync
If the user types "sync tech rules" or "generate stack rules",
perform the Auto-sync tech rules procedure immediately.

### Auto-sync tech rules
Triggered when:
- User explicitly requests "sync tech rules" or "generate stack rules"
- After completing a task that modified package manifests (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- When adding/removing major dependencies or frameworks

Procedure:
1.  Scan package manifests and file tree for languages/frameworks in use
2.  For each *newly detected* framework, library, or language:
    *   Append a concise stack-specific rule *below* '# --- tech-addon ---'
3.  For each rule already under '# --- tech-addon ---':
    *   If the referenced library or framework is **no longer present**, delete the rule
4.  When a library is **replaced** (e.g., Switch from Express to Fastify):
    *   Remove the obsolete rule for Express
    *   Append a new rule for Fastify
5.  Show the diff for approval and commit via the GitHub MCP with a Conventional-Commit message

## Memory Bank File Update Procedures

### PRD.md Updates:
*   Update project overview to reflect current scope and architecture
*   Add/update functional requirements with FR-XXX format and clear acceptance criteria
*   Append questions under "## Unanswered Questions" (never overwrite existing)
*   Ensure alignment between overview and detailed requirements

### architecture.md Updates:
*   Update technology stack with exact versions from package manifests
*   Add ADR entries: "YYYY-MM-DD ‚Äì Decision Title ‚Äì Brief description"
*   Include structured ADR sections: Decision, Rationale, Impact
*   Update system diagrams to match current implementation
*   Document new services, APIs, or major architectural changes

### TASK.md Updates:
*   NEVER use markdown checkboxes `[x]` or `[ ]` - ALWAYS use emoji status: ‚úÖüü°‚ùå
*   Move tasks between sections using emoji indicators (üî¥üü†üü¢ priority, ‚úÖüü°‚ùå status)
*   Before marking any Functional Requirement (FR) as complete:
    1. Verify ALL sub-tasks under that FR are marked ‚úÖ
    2. Only then add completion statement
*   When updating task status, replace the entire line with new emoji
*   Add tasks with clear descriptions and acceptance criteria
*   Include dependencies and blocking relationships
*   Archive completed tasks older than 14 days

### progress.md Updates:
*   Add entries: "YYYY-MM-DD ‚Äì ‚úÖ <past-tense summary>"
*   Include specific accomplishments, not just task completion
*   Reference relevant code changes, features, or fixes
*   Maintain reverse chronological order (newest first)

### MANUAL_ACTIONS.md Updates:
*   Add entries: "YYYY-MM-DD - [CATEGORY] Description - Status: Pending"
*   Categories: API_SETUP, ENV_CONFIG, EXTERNAL_SERVICE, PERMISSIONS, OTHER
*   Mark completed: "Status: Completed - [date]"
*   Archive completed actions older than 30 days

### "What shall we work on now?" Response Pattern:
*   Load and analyze TASK.md current state
*   Update memory bank files as needed
*   MUST conclude with: "**Next Action**: [specific task] - Ready to proceed?"
*   Wait for user confirmation before starting work



## Tech Addons

### Electron.js Best Practices
When working with Electron.js:

*   Utilize IPC (Inter-Process Communication) for communication between main and renderer processes
*   Be mindful of process-specific APIs (e.g., `BrowserWindow` in main, DOM manipulation in renderer)
*   Ensure context isolation and enable `contextBridge` for secure preload scripts
*   Follow security best practices outlined in the Electron documentation

### JavaScript Development Standards
When writing JavaScript:

*   Use modern ECMAScript features where appropriate (ES6+)
*   Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
*   Employ asynchronous patterns (Promises, async/await) for non-blocking operations
*   Follow a consistent coding style (e.g., Airbnb, StandardJS, or project-defined)

# --- tech-addon ---

### Conda Environment Management
When executing terminal commands for this project:

*   Always activate the conda environment "voiceapp" before running any commands
*   Use format: `conda run -n voiceapp [your_command]` for single commands
*   For multi-step operations, use `conda run -n voiceapp` for each command
*   This ensures all Python dependencies and project-specific libraries are available
